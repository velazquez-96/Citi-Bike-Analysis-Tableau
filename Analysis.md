# City Bike Analytics


Taking about the users age, there were two graphs that were made with this variable. The first one is about tripduration. Figure # shows that people between 16 and 19 years old, and some people from around their 70s tend to spend more time riding. This may be because they ride as a hobby . On the other hand, people between 20 and 60 years old spend less time riding. The latter may be due to they use a bike as a way to arrive to their jobs.
